# SignUpForm
Created a sign up form using Android Studio. <br /><br />

This application creates 4 TextViews which specify the parameter (i.e Name, Email, etc.) <br />
and 4 EditText widgets that allow the user to input their information. Once the submit <br />
button is clicked, all the getText() method is called for each of the EditText widgets. <br />
If any have an empty string (i.e the user didn't input anything), the ToastMessage is created <br />
asking the user to enter all fields. If all the fields have been filled out, but the passwords <br />
do not match, this will alert the user that the passwords do not match. If the user correctly <br />
filled out all forms properly, the Toast message "Welcome <Name>" will display.
